/// There are two kinds of things that can cause control to transfer back to
/// here from user code:
///
/// * System calls: the user code explicitly requests to call a procedure in
///   the Nachos kernel.  Right now, the only function we support is `Halt`.
///
/// * Exceptions: the user code does something that the CPU cannot handle.
///   For instance, accessing memory that does not exist, arithmetic errors,
///   etc.
///
/// Interrupts (which can also cause control to transfer from user code into
/// the Nachos kernel) are handled elsewhere.
///
/// For now, this only handles the `Halt` system call.  Everything else core
/// dumps.

/// * 2nd argument in `r5`;
/// * 3rd argument in `r6`;
/// * 4th argument in `r7`;

/// And do not forget to increment the pc before returning. (Or else you will
/// loop making the same system call forever!)
///
/// * `which` is the kind of exception.  The list of possible exceptions is
///   in `machine.hh`.
